# 30-Days-Practice-Challenge-for-AI-Engineer
# Day 1: Python & NumPy Fundamentals

## What I Learned:
- NumPy arrays are 10-100x faster than Python lists
- Arrays are the foundation of all AI/ML operations
- Images are just 3D arrays (height × width × channels)
- Vectorization eliminates slow loops

## Key Concepts:
- Array creation, indexing, slicing
- Broadcasting and reshaping
- Statistical operations
- Boolean indexing

## Project: Image Data Simulator
Simulated RGB image manipulation using NumPy arrays
