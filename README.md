# 30-Days-Practice-Challenge-for-AI-Engineer
# Day 1: Python & NumPy Fundamentals

## What I Learned:
- NumPy arrays are 10-100x faster than Python lists
- Arrays are the foundation of all AI/ML operations
- Images are just 3D arrays (height × width × channels)
- Vectorization eliminates slow loops

## Key Concepts:
- Array creation, indexing, slicing
- Broadcasting and reshaping
- Statistical operations
- Boolean indexing

# Day 2: Pandas & Data Manipulation

## What I Learned:
- DataFrames are the primary tool for data preprocessing in AI
- 90% of AI work is cleaning and preparing data
- Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Feature engineering creates new insights from raw data

## Key Concepts:
- DataFrame creation, selection, filtering
- Missing data handling (dropna, fillna)
- Groupby and aggregation
- Merging and pivoting datasets

## Project: Customer Churn Analysis
Analyzed 1000 customer records, cleaned data, engineered features, and extracted insights for ML modeling.

## Key Insights:
- Month-to-month contracts have highest churn
- Longer tenure = lower churn rate
- Data cleaned and ready for ML models

## Project: Image Data Simulator
Simulated RGB image manipulation using NumPy arrays
